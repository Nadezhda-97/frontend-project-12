The app for real-time communication. A very simplified version of Slack chat.

The app has three main pages: for login of already registered users, for registration of new users and the chat itself. There are two main channels for communication on the chat page – «general» and «random». At the same time, the user can create additional channels, as well as rename and delete them.

All messages are filtered for obscene words.
